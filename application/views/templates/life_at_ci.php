		  	<p class="first-office-text-prop">“A lot can happen over a coffee” Office happened. The first job happened. Good friends happened. Truly, a lot can happen over a coffee. CCD for everyone is a place of retreat. It is a place for hanging out with friends, first dates, some quality “me time” but for us ... it is our first office. There were lots of hurdles and obstacles that everyone had to face in the year 2020, but somehow, two girls ended up at CCD with a job in hand. Okay, one of us was late; that’s another story, but never mind, let’s continue – We used to pass by our first office every day on our way back home (until the lockdown happened again, of course!), we used to look at the beautiful CCD in white and red and remember the first 15 days of work at the coffee shop, among the chaos. It was just the three of us, our boss, and two writers. What could we do? We had no clue that the fire lit by our boss was going to be ignited into something as big as a forest fire! Now, we truly understand the meaning of “expect the unexpected”! Every day, we realize that we’re only a piece (an important piece at that!) of a huge puzzle called “Cast India”.The two things we see in us from then and now, is growth and change. Some of us had never felt growth so closely before. We are glad our first office was CCD and not an actual office because if it was, we wouldn’t understand in our whole lives, the process of growing; growing individually and growing as a team.</p>

		  	<p class="our-first-text-prop">Writing is a tough job, for real. We usually write for ourselves and share them with the world, without anyone’s approval. Ever since we started working here at Cast India, the real meaning of approvals came to light. How one approval can make you the happiest person. Being inclined towards the creative writing, the past few months were challenging, as working on technical writing mostly. Not that its boring (maybe it is a little), we surely learnt a whole lot of technical terms. But technical writing wasn’t as challenging as it’s thought it would be, compared to the content writing that had to be done for a client. It was our very First client! We had to make the most out of this opportunity and also, because it was our first client, we had to make this relationship a memorable one. You know, it was the “first impression is the last impression” sort of thing. Oh boy, content writing is TOUGH. Our writers were novice to content writing too. We had this anxiousness going on inside, everyone was facing it differently. Maybe it was because we had made ourselves comfortable with technical writing or that we just couldn’t picture the company well, it was eating us up. After having a good session of chat with sir and sharing our thoughts with him, it led us to a fresh new start. We researched, scribbled, doodled, danced about and just did almost everything that could inspire us to start penning our thoughts. Once we gathered, we started pouring down our thoughts, we didn’t stop and that’s when we realised that the gears were finally moving. Guess, we still needed a little bit of oiling to be done. With a little spice here and there, our work was finally approved!! What a relief! One of our colleagues, Radhika, updated the others about the final product, and we in that moment realised the amount of hard work and energy that everyone put in and the happiness of getting approved by the client had just brought a nonperishing smile on everyone’s face. These are the photos of that day, when the packaging was being cut out, how much fun we had! We still remember this day crystal clear and what our sir had said, “The proudest moment will be when you look at your work in the stores or on billboards or somewhere, no matter how big or small, that one accomplishment’s feelings cannot be described.” We surely felt those words inside our bones. If this is what accomplishment feels like for one client, we’re ready to take on more clients! Here’s to our first client and many more …</p>

		  	<p class="first-bday-cbdt-text-prop">We usually work on the 1st and the 3rd Saturday and luckily, Radhika’s birthday was also on a Saturday! It was just another ordinary yet special day. We greeted her and went back to work. Radhika wanted to leave early as it was her special day but when sir blatantly said no, we were a little disheartened. All day long the atmosphere felt dull and gloomy. But then, something unexpected happened! A surprise birthday party!! None of us saw this coming, and usually we go to the office terrace to eat lunch. Turns out, our sir had arranged for a cake, without anyone of us even getting to know he had planned all this and Radhika had called for some pizzas. Radhika was surely touched by such a warm gesture. On Monday when we were back to office, we got to know about another unexpected surprise! And once again our sir was the one, because of whom the second surprise party was possible. Sir was asked to keep Radhika back as her brother was preparing for her birthday party at home! A double surprise! Birthday or not, we all share a strong and indescribable bond. Our office is and will always a home away from home.</p>
